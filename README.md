# Loan-defaulter-prediction-models
In this project loan defaulter prediction models are designed to be used by financial institutions to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The goal of these models is to identify borrowers who are more likely to default so that lenders can take appropriate actions to mitigate risk.
